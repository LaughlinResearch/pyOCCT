py::enum_<TopAbs_Orientation>(mod, "TopAbs_Orientation", "Identifies the orientation of a topological shape. Orientation can represent a relation between two entities, or it can apply to a shape in its own right. When used to describe a relation between two shapes, orientation allows you to use the underlying entity in either direction. For example on a curve which is oriented FORWARD (say from left to right) you can have both a FORWARD and a REVERSED edge. The FORWARD edge will be oriented from left to right, and the REVERSED edge from right to left. In this way, you share the underlying entity. In other words, two faces of a cube can share an edge, and can also be used to build compound shapes. For each case in which an element is used as the boundary of a geometric domain of a higher dimension, this element defines two local regions of which one is arbitrarily considered as the default region. A change in orientation implies a switch of default region. This allows you to apply changes of orientation to the shape as a whole.")
